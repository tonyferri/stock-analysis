Analysis of DQ stock from 2017 to 2018

## Overview of Project:
The original intention of this analysis was to investigate the performance of one particular stock (DQ), but the scope widened to compare performance to other similar stock as well.

## Results:
The stock performance was vastly different between the two years.  2017 showed postive returns for all but one stock (TERP @ -7.2% return for the year).  Four seperate stocks had a return rate of over 100%, and the average rate of return for the year was 67%  DQ in particular had the highest return at 199%.  2018 reflected all negative returns with two exceptions (ENPH @ 82% and RUN @ 84%). The average return in 2018 was -8.5% and DQ was -62.6%.  Based on the fact that DQ performed significantly worse in the second year of this study, it would not be my recommendation to target that stock over better performers in the most recent year.  ENPH in particular showed favorable returns in both years.  Between the two scripts, the execution time was roughly ten times faster with the refactored code.

## Summary:
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantage: Faster execution of your script, less memory used
Disadvantage: The code itself may be more difficult to follow if someone new is coding

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
As I'm still trying to understand and retain how this code works, a more step by step process could be beneficial even if it is less efficient.
